# SpanishOral

As a student in Spanish 1 and Spanish 2, we were occassionally given oral exams - we would be given a sheet of potential questions a few days prior, and then we would be asked several of those questions. Studying orals by yourself was often challenging, as asking the questions to yourself doesn't really prepare you enough, which is why I have created this application.

Spanish Oral starts off by allowing you to enter several Spanish Questions, in this case, questions that you were given on an oral sheet. After you are done with that, you are transitioned to another screen you are asked randomly selected questions and tasked to answer them live. After you finish answering the question, a window will pop up with what you said in Spanish and the corresponding English translation. From there, you yourself can dictate whether you got the question right or wrong. When you have successfully answered all of the questions, you have the oppurtunity to restart all of the questions again. 

There are two main improvements that could possibly be made to this program in the future:
1. Graphics - Currently, the graphics of this program don't look very aesthetically pleasing. This is because I mainly focused on the functionality of the program rather than how good it looked. 
2. Other Languages - Although currently my program only supports Spanish orals, I could make an option to select other languages as well.
